Hello, this is a sample database connection pooling class I created for an interview.  
Naturally, in writing it, I sort of got carried away. :(

Perhaps it will be a useful example to someone else.

Latest version is at @ https://github.com/jandre/powerpool.  

 to build powerpool.jar:
 	- ant dist
 
 to run tests (some tests use hsqldb):
 	- ant test

 to create a connection pool:
 
 		SimpleConnectionPool pool = SimpleConnectionPool.createDefaultPool("org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver",
				"jdbc:hsqldb:mem:power-test", "sa", "");
		
		Connection connection = pool.getConnection();
		
		// TODO: do some stuff with the connection...
		
		pool.releaseConnection(connection);	// or, you can call connection.close();
		
		pool.stop();  // release any idle resources;.
		
	
 

Configuration options are controlled by the "Settings" class.  Basically, there's two things you can configure:

 1) MaximumIdleTimeSeconds:  the maximum time a free connection can idle before it is closed so the resources can be reclaimed. 
 
 	- the maximum time a free connection can idle before it is closed.  
  	- default = 60 * 5 seconds (5 minutes).   -1 = let all threads idle forever (not recommended unless you set a max limit.
  	
 2) MaximumConnections: maximum number of connections that can be assigned.  The pool will not block if the queue is full, it will throw an exception.
 	- default = unlimited connections.
 	- if you set this to <= 0, it resets it to unlimited.
